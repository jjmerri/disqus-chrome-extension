## Disqus Chrome Extension

This is an **UNOFFICIAL** Disqus Chrome extension that allows you to use Disqus on any site by clicking the extension icon to open a popup. This extension and the development of it is not in any way affiliated with or sponsored by Disqus and is 100% the sole effort of the owner of this repository.

## Development

### Scripts

- scripts/hot-reload.js: Automatically reloads changes so you don't have to constantly do so manually.

- scripts/disqus.js: An official disqus script that gets injected into pages with some manual modifications made to it so it will work within a Chrome Extension. The script is not designed to be used like this so it could stop working at any time if Disqus makes changes that are incompatible with it.
